# ðŸ§  Cohere Text Completion Chatbot

A simple command-line chatbot interface using the [Cohere API](https://cohere.com/) that allows dynamic adjustment of creativity during a session.

## Features

* Chat with Cohere's `command` model via the terminal
* Dynamically adjust creativity (temperature) between 0â€“1 during the session
* Handles both default and user-provided API keys
* Limits token response to avoid crashing

## Getting Started
